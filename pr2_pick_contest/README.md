# Contest information and strategy

## scripts/inventory.py
A node providing inventory management services, e.g. what items are in what
bins. On startup, it takes in a filename specifying a file that contains
the contest json.

## config/
Contains json files specifying the initial configuration and work order for
various demos.

## Future work
This package will contain strategy code, such as deciding which bins to
attempt to pick items from, in which order.
